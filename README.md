# LZW-Text-Compression

. A simple python implementation for the well-known compression algorithm LZW
. If you don't know much about it, this article may help: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lzw-lempel-ziv-welch-compression-technique/

# How To Run Encoder:

    - Modify "Input.txt" and write there the text you want to compress
    - The input text may contain charachter from keyboard (even spaces and special characters)

# How To Run Decoder:

    - Make sure you have run the Encoder file with your text before trying to run decoder
    - "Output.txt" file will be created for you which contain the original text

# Future Work:

    . Develop the algorithm for Image-Compression
