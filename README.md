# LZW-Text-Compression

- A simple python implementation for the well-known compression algorithm LZW

- If you don't know much about it, this article may help: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lzw-lempel-ziv-welch-compression-technique/

# How To Run Encoder
1. **Modify *Input.txt* and write there the text you want to compress**
2. **The input text may contain character from keyboard (even spaces and special characters)**

# How To Run Decoder
1. **Make sure you have run the Encoder file with your text before trying to run decoder**
2. **_Output.txt_ file will be created for you which contain the original text**

# Future Work
   **Develop the algorithm for Image-Compression**
